    <h1>Website Temporarily in Transition</h1>

    <p>
      This site is currently being reworked as part of an accessibility-focused
      LaTeX-to-HTML workflow project for undergraduate mathematics study.
    </p>

    <div class="note" role="note" aria-label="Project status note">
      <strong>Current status:</strong> the previous Pandoc-rendered site is not the active display baseline.
      The current development focus is a <strong>tex4ht / make4ht</strong> conversion pipeline
      with MathML-first output and screen-reader testing (Firefox + NVDA).
    </div>

    <h2>Why this placeholder is here</h2>
    <p>
      The repository file system is being retained for now while the tex4ht conversion workflow
      is stabilized. This allows ongoing experiments and evidence logs to remain organized without
      breaking existing paths too early.
    </p>

    <h2>Planned direction</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Continue improving tex4ht conversion reliability on more complex source .tex files</li>
      <li>Improve theorem/proof discoverability for screen-reader navigation</li>
      <li>Reuse the current file system once the tex4ht pipeline is stable enough</li>
      <li>Simplify structure later (likely removing the dual pipeline comparison)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Repository status</h2>
    <p>
      This repository currently contains both:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>earlier Pandoc exploration artifacts (kept as evidence and pivot rationale), and</li>
      <li>current tex4ht experiments and Week 1 evidence logs.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      If you are reviewing this project, please refer to the evidence and experiment folders for
      the latest technical progress.

        Placeholder page for workflow transition. Root <code>index.html</code> will be replaced
        when the tex4ht-based publishing pipeline is stable.
