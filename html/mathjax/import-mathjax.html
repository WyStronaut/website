<p><em>Lectured in Michaelmas by <span
class="smallcaps">Prof. I. B. Leader</span></em></p>
<p>This course gives an introduction to university level maths. We begin
by presenting some basic rules, called axioms. Then, we carefully prove
logical statements that follow from these axioms. We build upon our
previous results iteratively until we have proven some important
theorems. Almost every other course in an undergraduate maths course
will follow this pattern, and this course acts as a prototypical
example.</p>
<p>In the first part of the course, we rigorously define the natural
numbers, integers, rationals, and reals. Using the axioms, we can prove
facts about things like prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and limits.
In the second half of the course, we establish the notion of a set, and
define what concepts like functions are. At the end, we use the rules of
sets to prove that there are different sizes of infinity.</p>
