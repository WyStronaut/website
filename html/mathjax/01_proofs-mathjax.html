<h2 id="motivation-for-proof">Motivation for proof</h2>
<h3>Definition</h3>
<p>A proof is a logical argument that establishes a conclusion.</p>
<p>Clearly there are some things missing from this definition; we have
not yet defined a ‘logical argument’ or a ‘conclusion’; however we have
to start somewhere, and assuming understanding of logic is a good place
to start. There is a 3rd year course called ‘Logic and Set Theory’ that
rigorously defines this.</p>
<p>There are two main reasons to want to prove things.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>To be sure that they are true; and</p></li>
<li><p>to understand why they are true.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For the first point, it is easy to make a contrived example that
shows why we need to prove statements even though they appear to be true
for small <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, for example: ‘all
positive integers <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> are not equal
to 100 trillion’. Understanding the reasoning behind why a statement is
true is also very important; an example of this is at the end of this
lecture.</p>
<h2 id="proofs-and-non-proofs">Proofs and non-proofs</h2>
<h3>Claim</h3>
<p>For any positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>,
<span class="math inline">\(n^3-n\)</span> is a multiple of 3.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Given some positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>,
we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n^3 - n = (n-1)n(n+1)\]</span></p>
<p>One of <span class="math inline">\(n-1,\,n,\,n+1\)</span> must be a
multiple of 3 as they are 3 consecutive integers.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\((n-1)n(n+1)\)</span> must be a
multiple of 3. ◻</p>
<p>There are a couple of things to note about this proof.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The phrase ‘given a positive integer’ is important; we need to
know where this variable <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> came
from.</p></li>
<li><p>We used the fact that three consecutive numbers contain a
multiple of 3 here, but this was not proven. We must prove this fact
elsewhere, or we cannot use it in this course!</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to write proofs legibly and linearly down the
page; don’t just write a long line of symbols.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Claim</h3>
<p>For any positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, if
<span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is even then <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Given a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that
is even, we have <span class="math inline">\(n=2k\)</span> for some
integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus <span class="math inline">\(n^2 = (2k)^2 = 4k^2 =
2(2k^2)\)</span>,</p>
<p>so <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is even. ◻</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>This is a false proof. We proved that <span class="math inline">\(B
\implies A\)</span>, but we want <span class="math inline">\(A \implies
B\)</span>. Our result wasn’t false, but it didn’t show what we set out
to prove. The words ‘for some integer <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>’ are important: we must specify which
set <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> belongs to. Our proof would
be incorrect if we did not state this, as it would be unclear that <span
class="math inline">\(2(2k^2)\)</span> is an even number.</p>
<h3>Claim</h3>
<p>For any positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, if
<span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is a multiple of 9 then <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a multiple of 9.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Given a positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that
is a multiple of 9, we have <span class="math inline">\(n=9k\)</span>
for some integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(n^2 = (9k)^2 = 81k^2 =
9(9k^2)\)</span>,</p>
<p>so <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is a multiple of 9. ◻</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>Not only does this fall for the same trap as the previous proof, but
the original claim is false (e.g. <span
class="math inline">\(n=6\)</span>)! It’s entirely irrelevant that the
claim is true for some positive integers, because even one
counterexample disproves the claim.</p>
<p>Let’s return now to the previous incorrect example: ‘if <span
class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> even then <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> even for all positive integers <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>’.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd.</p>
<p>We have <span class="math inline">\(n = 2k+1\)</span> for some
integer <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(n^2 = (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1
= 2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is odd</p>
<p>Therefore <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even. ◻</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We prove things to show <em>why</em> something is true. We can
see why this claim was true here—it’s really a statement about the
properties of odd numbers, not the properties of even numbers.</p></li>
<li><p>We started by saying that we need something tangible to work
with: just stating that ‘<span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is
even’ is really hard to work with because square roots just get messy
and don’t yield any result. So we had to choose a clever first
step.</p></li>
<li><p>The symbol shows that we have a contradiction.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This was a kind of proof by contradiction. Essentially, <span
class="math inline">\(A \implies B\)</span> is the same as saying <span
class="math inline">\(\neg B \implies \neg A\)</span>. This is
because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(A \implies B\)</span> means that
there is no case such that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is
false and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is true.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\neg B \implies \neg A\)</span> means
that there is no case such that <span class="math inline">\(\neg
B\)</span> is false and <span class="math inline">\(\neg A\)</span> is
true. In other words, there is no case such that <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is true and <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is false. This is equivalent to the
case with <span class="math inline">\(A \implies B\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Claim</h3>
<p>The solution to the real equation <span
class="math inline">\(x^2-5x+6=0\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(x=2\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(x=3\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>This is really two assertions:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x=2 \lor x=3 \implies x^2 - 5x + 6 =
0\)</span>, and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \implies x=2 \lor
x=3\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>We can denote this using a two-way implication symbol <span
class="math inline">\(\iff\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[x=2
\lor x=3 \iff x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\]</span></p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>We prove case i by expressing the left hand side as a product of
factors: <span class="math inline">\((x-3)(x-2)=0\)</span>. The other
case may be proven using factorisation. ◻</p>
<p>We can do another kind of proof using <span
class="math inline">\(\iff\)</span> symbols a lot. However, we need to
be absolutely sure that each step really is a bi-implication.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>For any real <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>: <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
        x^2-5x+6=0 &amp; \iff (x-2)(x-3) = 0       \\
                   &amp; \iff x-2 = 0 \lor x-3 = 0 \\
                   &amp; \iff x=2 \lor x = 3
\end{align*}\]</span> ◻</p>
<h3>Claim</h3>
<p>Every positive real is at least 1.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be the smallest positive
real. We want to prove <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span>, so we
prove this by contradiction.</p>
<p>Case 1: if <span class="math inline">\(x &lt; 1\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(x^2 &lt; x\)</span></p>
<p>Case 2: if <span class="math inline">\(x &gt; 1\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(\sqrt{x} &lt; x\)</span></p>
<p>Therefore <span class="math inline">\(x=1\)</span> ◻</p>
<h3>Note</h3>
<p>The assertion that there exists a smallest positive real is not
justified. This means that the proof is invalid in its entirety. It is
important that every line in a proof must be justified.</p>
