<h2 id="the-natural-numbers">The natural numbers</h2>
<p>Each line in a proof must be justified. So, in number theory, what
are you allowed to assume? We must begin with a set of axioms. We define
that the natural numbers are a set denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb N\)</span>, that contains an element
denoted 1, with an operation <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>
satisfying:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\forall n \in \mathbb N, n + 1 \neq
1\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\forall m,n \in \mathbb N, m \neq n
\implies m+1 \neq n+1\)</span> (together with the previous rule, this
captures the idea that all numbers in <span
class="math inline">\(\mathbb N\)</span> are distinct)</p></li>
<li><p>For any property <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span>, if
<span class="math inline">\(p(1)\)</span> is true and <span
class="math inline">\(p(n) \implies p(n+1) \ \forall n \in \mathbb
N\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(p(n) \ \forall n \in
\mathbb N\)</span> (induction axiom).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This list of rules is known as the Peano axioms. Note that we did not
include 0 in this set. You can show that the list of natural numbers is
complete and has no extras (like the rational number <span
class="math inline">\(3.5\)</span>) by specifying <span
class="math inline">\(p(n)=\)</span> ‘<span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is on the list of natural numbers’.</p>
<p>Note that while numbers are defined as, for example, <span
class="math inline">\(1+1+1+1\)</span>, we are free to use whatever
names we like, e.g. 4 or 3735928559.</p>
<p>We may also define our own operations, such as <span
class="math inline">\(+2\)</span>, which is defined to be <span
class="math inline">\(+1+1\)</span>. In fact, we can define the
operation <span class="math inline">\(+k\)</span> for any <span
class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb N\)</span> by stating: <span
class="math display">\[(n+k)+1 = n+(k+1) \quad(\forall n, k \in \mathbb
N)\]</span> and using induction to construct the <span
class="math inline">\(+k\)</span> operator for all <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. We can similarly construct
multiplication and exponentiation operators for all natural numbers,
although this is omitted here. We can also prove properties on these
operators such as associativity, commutativity and distributivity.</p>
<p>We can also define the <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>
operator as follows: <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b \iff \exists k
\in \mathbb N \st a + k = b\)</span>. Of course, we can also prove
several properties using this rule, such as transitivity, and the fact
that <span class="math inline">\(a \nless a\)</span>, which are omitted
here.</p>
<h2 id="strong-induction">Strong induction</h2>
<p>The induction axiom states that if we know</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(1)\)</span> is true, and</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(n) \implies p(n+1)\)</span> for any
<span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb N\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>then we can conclude that <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span>
is true for all <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb N\)</span>. We
can in fact prove a stronger statement using this axiom, known as
‘strong induction’.</p>
<h3>Claim</h3>
<p>If we know that</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(p(1)\)</span> is true, and</p></li>
<li><p>the fact that <span class="math inline">\(p(k)\)</span> is true
for all <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; n\)</span> implies that <span
class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> is true</p></li>
</ul>
<p>then <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> is true for all <span
class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb N\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Consider the predicate <span class="math inline">\(q(n)\)</span>
defined as: ‘<span class="math inline">\(p(k)\)</span> is true for all
<span class="math inline">\(k &lt; n\)</span>’. Given that <span
class="math inline">\(p(1)\)</span> is true, <span
class="math inline">\(q(1)\)</span> is trivially true since there are no
<span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> below 1. Since <span
class="math inline">\(q(n) \implies q(n+1)\)</span>, we can use the
induction axiom, showing that <span class="math inline">\(q(n)\)</span>
is true for all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> is true for all <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. ◻</p>
<p>This provides a very useful alternative way of looking at induction.
Instead of just considering a process from <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>, we can inject an inductive viewpoint
into any proof. When proving something on the natural numbers, we can
always assume that the hypothesis is true for smaller <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> than what we are currently using. This
allows us to write very powerful proofs because in the general case we
are allowed to refer back to other smaller cases—but not just <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>, any <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> less than <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We may rewrite the principle of strong induction in the following
ways:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> is false for some
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, there must be some <span
class="math inline">\(m\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(p(m)\)</span> is false and <span
class="math inline">\(p(k)\)</span> is true for all <span
class="math inline">\(k&lt;m\)</span>. In other words, if a
counterexample exists, there must exist a minimal
counterexample.</p></li>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span> is true for some
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, then there is a smallest <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(p(n)\)</span>. In other words, if an example
exists, there must exist a minimal example. This is known as the
‘well-ordering principle’.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-integers-and-rationals">The integers and rationals</h2>
<p>The integers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Z\)</span> consist
of the set of natural numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb
N\)</span>, their additive inverses, and an identity element denoted 0.
In other words, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb Z, +)\)</span> is
the group generated by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb N\)</span>
and the addition operator: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Z =
\genset{\mathbb N}\)</span>. We define operations in a familiar way, for
example <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b \iff \exists c \in \mathbb
N \st a+c = b\)</span>.</p>
<p>The rational numbers <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb Q\)</span>
consist of all expressions denoted <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(a, b \in \mathbb Z\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(b \neq 0\)</span>; with <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b}\)</span> regarded as the same as <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{c}{d}\)</span> if and only if <span
class="math inline">\(ad=bc\)</span>. We define, for example, <span
class="math display">\[\frac{a}{b} + \frac{c}{d} = \frac{ad +
bc}{bd}\]</span> Note that is important to verify with each operation
that it does not matter how you write a given rational number. For
example, <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} =
\frac{2}{4} + \frac{3}{6}\)</span>. This means that operations such as
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{a}{b} \mapsto \frac{a^3}{b^2}\)</span>
cannot exist because then it would depend on how you write the rational
number.</p>
<h2 id="primes">Primes</h2>
<h3>Proposition</h3>
<p>Every <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 2\)</span> is expressible as
a product of primes.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>We use induction on an integer <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, starting at 2, a trivial case. Given
<span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 2\)</span>, we have two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is prime. Therefore, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a product of primes as
required.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is composite. We know that
<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> can be split into two factors,
denoted here as <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Using (strong) induction, we know that
because both <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are smaller than <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, they are expressible as a product of
primes. We simply multiply these products together to express <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> as a product of primes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p> ◻</p>
<h3>Proposition</h3>
<p>There are infinitely many primes.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Assume there exists a largest prime. Then, the list of primes is
<span class="math inline">\(p_1, p_2 \cdots p_k\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(n=p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k + 1\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> has no prime factor. This is a
contradiction immediately because we know that every number greater than
two has a factorisation, but this doesn’t. ◻</p>
<p>We want to prove that prime factorisation is unique (up to the
ordering). We need that <span class="math inline">\(p \mid ab \implies p
\mid a \lor p \mid b\)</span>. However, this is hard to answer—<span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is defined in terms of what divides it,
not what it divides. This is the reverse of its definition, so we need
to prove it in a more round-about way.</p>
<h2 id="highest-common-factors">Highest common factors</h2>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in \mathbb N\)</span>, a number
<span class="math inline">\(c \in \mathbb N\)</span> is defined to be
the highest common factor if:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(c \mid a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c \mid b\)</span>, and</p></li>
<li><p>For all other factors <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>
(<span class="math inline">\(d \mid a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(d \mid b\)</span>), we have that <span
class="math inline">\(d \mid c\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The second point implies that it is the <em>highest</em> common
factor, but it is actually slightly stronger. Note that, for example, if
a pair’s common factors were 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 then the numbers would not
have a highest common factor, because 4 does not divide 6.</p>
<h2 id="the-division-algorithm">The division algorithm</h2>
<p>The division algorithm allows us to write any number <span
class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb N\)</span> as a multiple <span
class="math inline">\(q\in\mathbb N\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(k\in \mathbb N\)</span> with some remainder <span
class="math inline">\(r\in\mathbb N\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\(0 \leq r &lt; k\)</span>; this can be shortened to
<span class="math inline">\(n = qk + r\)</span>. We begin by writing 1
in this form: <span class="math inline">\(1 = 0k + 1\)</span>.
Inductively, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> can be written as:
<span class="math display">\[n = (n-1) + 1 = q_0 k + r_0 + 1\]</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r_0\)</span> are the results of <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span>. Note that we have two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If <span class="math inline">\(r_0 + 1 &lt; k\)</span>: the
result is simply <span class="math inline">\(n = q_0k +
(r_0+1)\)</span></p></li>
<li><p>Else (<span class="math inline">\(r_0 + 1 = k\)</span>): the
result is <span class="math inline">\(n = (q_0 + 1)k +
0\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="euclids-algorithm">Euclid’s algorithm</h2>
<p>We can find the highest common factor of two natural numbers <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (without loss of generality, we assume
that <span class="math inline">\(a \leq b\)</span>). This process is
known as Euclid’s algorithm.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Write <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> as some multiple
<span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, with remainder <span
class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Write <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> as some multiple
<span class="math inline">\(q_2\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span>, with remainder <span
class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Write <span class="math inline">\(r_1\)</span> as some multiple
<span class="math inline">\(q_3\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(r_2\)</span>, with remainder <span
class="math inline">\(r_3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue until <span class="math inline">\(r_{n+1}=0\)</span>.
Then, <span class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span> is the highest common
factor of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. We know that the algorithm terminates
because <span class="math inline">\(r_k &lt; r_{k-1}\)</span> so it will
terminate in at most <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>
steps.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We now prove that the algorithm works.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>We need to prove that it is a common factor and then that it divides
all other common factors.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>On the last line of the algorithm, we have <span
class="math inline">\(r_{n-1} = q_{n+1} r_n + 0\)</span>, so we know
that <span class="math inline">\(r_n \mid r_{n-1}\)</span>. On the
second last line, we have <span class="math inline">\(r_{n-2} = q_n
r_{n-1} + r_n\)</span>, but <span class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span>
divides <span class="math inline">\(r_{n-1}\)</span>, so <span
class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span> must divide <span
class="math inline">\(r_{n-2}\)</span>. We can continue this logic up to
the start of the algorithm, where we can see that <span
class="math inline">\(r_n \mid a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r_n \mid b\)</span>. So <span
class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span> is a common factor of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Given some other common factor <span class="math inline">\(d \neq
r_n\)</span>, we can look at the first line of the algorithm to see that
<span class="math inline">\(d \mid r_1\)</span>. Using this, we can use
the next line to see that <span class="math inline">\(d \mid
r_2\)</span>. Continuing to the last line, we have <span
class="math inline">\(d \mid r_n\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So <span class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span> is the highest common
factor of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. Therefore, the highest common factor
exists and is unique for any natural numbers <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. ◻</p>
<p>Consider running Euclid’s algorithm on the numbers 87 and 52. <span
class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    87 &amp; = 1 \cdot 52 + 35 \\
    52 &amp; = 1 \cdot 35 + 17 \\
    35 &amp; = 2 \cdot 17 + 1  \\
    17 &amp; = 17 \cdot 1 + 0
\end{align*}\]</span> 1 is the highest common factor of 87 and 52. Now,
we can write 1 as a linear combination of 87 and 52 by looking at each
line of this algorithm in the reverse direction (ignoring the bottom
line). <span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
    1 &amp; = 35 - 2 \cdot 17                         \\
      &amp; = 35 - 2 \cdot (52 - 1 \cdot 35)          \\
      &amp; = -2 \cdot 52 + 3 \cdot 35                \\
      &amp; = -2 \cdot 52 + 3 \cdot (87 - 1 \cdot 52) \\
      &amp; = 3 \cdot 87 - 5 \cdot 52
\end{align*}\]</span> Each two lines of this equation represents one
line on Euclid’s algorithm. We end up with a linear combination of the
two input numbers. We can prove that this linear combination exists in
the general case.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in \mathbb N\)</span>. Then
there exist some <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \mathbb Z\)</span>
such that <span class="math inline">\(xa + yb = \HCF(a, b)\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Run Euclid’s algorithm on <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, and let the output be <span
class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span>. Then we have <span
class="math inline">\(r_n = x r_{n-1} + y r_{n-2}\)</span> for some
<span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \mathbb Z\)</span>. So, <span
class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span> can be written as a linear
combination of <span class="math inline">\(r_{n-1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r_{n-2}\)</span>. Also, from the previous line we
know that <span class="math inline">\(r_{n-1} = x r_{n-2} + y
r_{n-3}\)</span> for some other <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. So we can rewrite <span
class="math inline">\(r_{n}\)</span> as a linear combination of <span
class="math inline">\(r_{n-2}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(r_{n-3}\)</span>. Inductively, we can rewrite
<span class="math inline">\(r_n\)</span> as a linear combination of
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> by moving up the lines of the
algorithm. ◻</p>
<p>We can also make an alternate proof without using Euclid’s algorithm.
Note that this algorithm does not show how to generate this linear
combination, it just shows that one exists.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> be the least positive
linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. We want to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(h = \HCF (a, b)\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Assume that there exists some common factor <span
class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, so that <span
class="math inline">\(d\mid a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(d\mid b\)</span>. Then for some <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(d \mid (xa
+ yb)\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(d \mid
h\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> does not divide
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(a = qh + r\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(q\)</span> is the quotient and <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is the remainder (<span
class="math inline">\(r \neq 0\)</span>). Then <span
class="math inline">\(r = a - qh = a - q(xa + yb)\)</span> for some
integers <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. So <span
class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is a linear combination of <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. But this is a contradiction because we
said that <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> was the smallest one.
So <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is the highest
common factor. ◻</p>

<p>Suppose <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> are natural numbers. When can we solve
<span class="math inline">\(ax + by = c\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(x, y \in \mathbb Z\)</span>? Well, by looking at
the previous theorem, we might guess that <span
class="math inline">\(c\)</span> must be some multiple of the highest
common factor of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. This can be proven in the general
case.</p>
<h3>Corollary</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c \in \mathbb N\)</span>. Then
<span class="math inline">\(ax + by = c\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(x, y \in \mathbb Z\)</span> has a solution if and
only if <span class="math inline">\(\HCF(a, b) \mid c\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(h = \HCF(a, b)\)</span>. We must
prove this bi-implication in both directions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>First, let us assume that <span
class="math inline">\(ax+by=c\)</span> has a solution for some integers
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(h
\mid a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h \mid b\)</span> then
<span class="math inline">\(h \mid (ax+by)\)</span> so <span
class="math inline">\(h \mid c\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Conversely, we know that <span class="math inline">\(h = ax +
by\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> by the above theorem. We can multiply
both sides by the integer <span class="math inline">\(c/h\)</span> (this
is an integer because <span class="math inline">\(h \mid c\)</span>).
Then we have an expression for <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> as
a linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> as required.</p></li>

<h3>Lemma</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be a prime, let <span
class="math inline">\(a, b \in \mathbb N\)</span>. Then <span
class="math inline">\(p \mid ab\)</span> implies <span
class="math inline">\(p \mid a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(p
\mid b\)</span>.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(p \mid ab\)</span>. Then we have two
cases, either <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or it does not divide <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. If it does, our statement is trivially
true. Otherwise, we want to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now <span class="math inline">\(\HCF(p, a)=1\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is a prime, and it does not divide
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. So 1 can be written as some
linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(px + ay =
1\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(x, y \in \mathbb
Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we can multiply both sides by <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, giving <span class="math inline">\(pbx
+ aby = b\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> divides
<span class="math inline">\(ab\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> must divide the left hand side. So
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> divides <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span>. ◻</p>
<p>Note that we started with a kind of ‘negative’ statement: ‘<span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> does not divide <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span>’; this told us that we cannot do
something (namely, factorise it). We turned it into a ‘positive’
statement: ‘<span class="math inline">\(px + ay = 1\)</span>’; this
allows us to rearrange to find out information about these variables.
Converting ‘negative’ statements to ‘positive’ statements is a useful
tool in making proofs.</p>
<h3>Theorem</h3>
<p>Every <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb N\)</span> is
uniquely expressible as a product of primes.</p>
<h3>Proof</h3>
<p>Note that we have already proven that a prime factorisation is
possible in Section 3.4; we just need to prove uniqueness of a
factorisation (at least, down to its order). We will use induction on
some integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that we wish to
factorise. Clearly the theorem is true for <span
class="math inline">\(n=1\)</span> (assuming empty products are valid)
and <span class="math inline">\(n=2\)</span>.</p>
<p>So given that <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 2\)</span> we
suppose that there exist two possible factorisations: <span
class="math display">\[n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k = q_1 q_2 \cdots
q_l\]</span> We want to prove that <span
class="math inline">\(k=l\)</span> and that (after reordering) <span
class="math inline">\(p_i = q_i\)</span> for all valid <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>We know that <span class="math inline">\(p_1 \mid n\)</span>, so
<span class="math inline">\(p_1 \mid (q_1 \cdots q_l)\)</span>. So there
must exist some <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 \mid q_i\)</span>. But since <span
class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is prime, <span
class="math inline">\(p_1 = q_i\)</span>. Let us reorder the list such
that <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span> is moved to the front, so
that <span class="math inline">\(p_1 = q_1\)</span>. <span
class="math display">\[n = p_1 p_2 \cdots p_k = p_1 q_2 \cdots
q_l\]</span> Now, we divide the entire equation by <span
class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span> to give <span
class="math display">\[\frac{n}{p_1} = p_2 \cdots p_k = q_2 \cdots
q_l\]</span> The integer <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{p_1}\)</span> is smaller than <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, so we can use induction to assume that
its factorisation is unique. Therefore <span
class="math display">\[[p_2, p_3 \cdots p_k] = [q_2, q_3 \cdots
q_l]\]</span> So the prime factorisation of <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is unique. ◻</p>
<p>The common factors of two numbers <span class="math inline">\(m =
p_1^{a_1} \cdots p_k^{a_k}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n =
p_1^{b_1} \cdots p_k^{b_k}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are zero or above is given by <span
class="math inline">\(p_1^{c_1} \cdots p_k^{c_k}\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(c_i \leq \min(a_i, b_i)\)</span> So the highest
common factor is given by <span class="math inline">\(c_i = \min(a_i,
b_i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The common multiples of those two numbers is given by <span
class="math inline">\(d_i \geq \max(a_i, b_i)\)</span>. So analogously
the lowest common multiple is given by <span class="math inline">\(d_i =
\max(a_i, b_i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have the interesting property that <span
class="math inline">\(\HCF(m, n) \LCM(m, n) = mn\)</span>. This is true
because any term <span class="math inline">\(p_i\)</span> is given by
<span class="math inline">\(p_i^{\min(a_i, b_i)}p_i^{\max(a_i, b_i)} =
p_i^{a_i + b_i}\)</span>.</p>
