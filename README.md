# WyStronaut Website

Accessibility-focused website rebuild for undergraduate mathematics study.

## Current Status
- Pandoc workflow is archived
- Active baseline: tex4ht / make4ht
- Output mode: MathML + MathJax
- Primary testing target: Firefox + NVDA

## Folder Guide
- `project/` project docs, workflow notes, logs
- `experiments/tex4ht-pipeline/` active tex4ht conversion experiments
- `evidence/tex4ht/week1/` Week 1 setup and test evidence
- `site-output/` generated site output
- `archive/pandoc/` historical Pandoc materials (unchanged)

## Key Files
- `WORKFLOW-STATUS.md` compact workflow status
- `index.html` placeholder page during transition

## Next Step
Test more complex `.tex` inputs and record accessibility results.
