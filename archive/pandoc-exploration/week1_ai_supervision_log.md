## 1. Purpose

This log documents how AI tools were used during Week 1,
including human oversight and verification steps.

The goal is to ensure transparency, auditability, and responsible use.

---

## 2. AI Tools Used

- ChatGPT (documentation support, workflow design)
- (List any others if applicable)

---

## 3. AI-Assisted Activities

### A. Workflow Structuring Assistance

Prompt summary:  Requested help structuring Week 1 goals around MathML + Firefox + NVDA testing.

Outcome: Week 1 scope refinement, Dual-output architecture framing, Structured testing phases, Success criteria

Human verification: Accepted structural outline. Modified scope to focus specifically on MathML testing.

---

### B. Documentation Templates

Prompt summary: Requested templates for ai supervision log, feasibility memo, firefox render test, mathml build log, nvda mathml test log

Outcome: Generated structured markdown templates including:
Build feasibility section, Risk classification, Responsible use statement

Action taken: Reviewed templates. Accepted structure. Will populate content manually based on empirical testing.

Risk note:
Templates provide structure but do not constitute evidence themselves.

---

### C. Directory Placement Advice

Prompt summary:  Asked where logs should reside in repository.

Outcome:  Proposed /docs/accessibility-workflow/week1/.

Human verification: Accepted directory structure. Confirmed it aligns with repository organization principles.

- All accessibility tests were performed directly by the author.
- AI outputs were treated as suggestions, not authoritative decisions.
- All conclusions were independently evaluated.

## 5. Rejected AI Suggestions (if any)

Description:
Reason for rejection:

---

## 6. Risk Considerations

Potential AI risks:
- Overconfidence in generated explanations
- Incorrect interpretation of accessibility behavior
- Missed edge cases

Mitigation:
- Manual verification
- Cross-checking output in browser
- Empirical NVDA testing

---

## 7. Responsible Use Statement

AI was used as a documentation and reasoning assistant.
All technical validation and accessibility evaluation
remained under human control.

No automated deployment occurred without review.
